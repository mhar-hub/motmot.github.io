    <p>Hey my heart! I do not think that you have now expected, or I know it. I simply wanted to thank you in this way. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!! Simple for everything. I know it's not always easy with me, but still you stay, just give me that and bring me back to reality again and again. If anything bothers me, you're the first to know it, and also the one who does not believe me when I say that everything is alright. What I feel for you is something new, something special! You are something special!!! You give me so much love, affection, tenderness & 'especially the feeling of being important. Every time I look into your eyes, I can see my future. OUR FUTURE! A life without you is inconceivable to me. You are the best, most wonderful, greatest, most brilliant, most perfect thing that could happen to me. You have left me in your heart and in your life and for that I am more than grateful to you! I love you so indescribably that there are no words for it. Even if there were any, they would not nearly describe what I feel for you!You are my heart, my life, my future. My hand in yours, FOREVER! When I think of our moments, my lips make a smile, no matter what condition. Alone the thought of you makes me the happiest person of this time. You can not believe what you trigger in me. You are like drinking champagne, in the moment when the tingling water touches the lips you want more of them. As if to reach for the stars, that's how it is with you. Stop is not available because you can not. Every night when I wake up and lie next to you, I just watch you. Your beauty, which you are not aware of. I believe you are not aware of anything that concerns you. Your beauty, your charming character, your beautiful smile. You give one the reason to stare permanently, the eyes can not let go of you. You can not keep your hands off, even if you want to.To think of you, to touch you, to watch you laugh are the three most beautiful events that can happen to you. There is no point in resisting it. I want you now, in 10 years and even when I'm old and ugly to same. You made my heart blossom right the first day. I was searching all the time and now I found you. There is no better than you and never will be.I can confirm that to you 100 percent. As I told you before, it is a privilege to love you but also to be loved by you and I am more than happy that I may be the ones. Without you, life is meaningless and empty. Like the depth of the sea.To look in your eyes is like the starry sky. There is no choice but to look into it. Your smile you lose in this. There is no choice but to smile with you. Your laughter are the most beautiful sounds this world has heard. There is no choice but to laugh. Your voice is a unique tune. There is no choice but to listen. Your touch is like a soulful dance on the skin. There is no choice but to enjoy it. You. There is no choice but to love you. My angel,How I wish that you were by my side now. The yearning for you is growing every day and I miss you more than words can ever say. Without you, I feel incomplete. You leave a big gap as soon as you go again. But even if you live in another country and we do not see each other very often, I feel so incredibly close to you. No limit to the world can separate us. Because I love you! And this love overcomes every distance, every barrier, every country in the world. When you are with me and I hold you in my arms, time suddenly seems to stand still. And yet the time passes with you too fast. It slides like sand out of my fingers and I try to hold on to it every time, so as not to let you go again. Because among all the women in the world you are the one to which every man hopes. You are the woman who makes my heart beat faster even after all the time we are together. It manages to make me stand up at the airport with my knees trembling, thinking, "It will arrive right away!" You make me weak and at the same time so incredibly strong!Since you came into my life, I have the feeling that I finally know what it really means to live. You are so much more than my partner. You are my inspiration, my compass, my best friend. Waking up at your side every day is my biggest wish. I want to share every adventure with you, sharing every experience with you. For what is more beautiful than to grow beyond yourself with his soul mate? Darling, you make life so incredibly worth living and for that I want to thank you! You are more than I have ever wanted!I know that we do not see each other as often as our hearts wish. But every day, every hour with you is so infinitely precious. When I think about seeing you again, I feel a tingling in my whole body! And so I often find myself dreaming to you in the distance and to lay in my thoughts to you. Wake you up and experience one more of these wonderful days together that make life so precious.You should always know one thing: in my thoughts I am always with you! And in the heart we are always close! No matter where we are right now.I love you with my whole heart! I'm so sorry about what happened yesterday between us. I do not know either, lately I'm almost in a bad mood, because the work gets more and more tedious and of course leaves that to you ...I really did not want to yell at you and certainly do not have any stupid comments popping on your head. You know, you are the most important thing in my life and I love you about everything in the world. I can only imagine my future together with you. You have become part of me, my better half, my life content, something very special, that deserves to be treated differently.Ever since I saw you for the first time, I knew it: this is the woman I love and with whom I can grow old and happy.I admit my mistake and hereby give you my word of honor that such a thing will never happen again.Trust is very important to me and you know that this has always played an important role in our relationship so far. That will not change, my angel.Only you and me against the rest of the world!Do you forgive me? I know you are modest and always embarrassed when complimented, but you are just beautiful. When your hair blows in the wind, your eyes are beaming, and your nose is kissed by the sun, and that's why it's so cute, then every time I wonder if you're not an angel on earth.Listening to your voice always gives me goose bumps, especially in the moments when you pay attention to me alone. If you're happy, then I have to smile all the time and get infected by your good mood. I do not know how you do that, but you always enchant me again and again. No matter what, if I know I'll see you, then the day will be fine. You are my sun. For you, I like to get up every day, just to see you shine so beautifully.Hello my darling,all the love for our anniversary. For me, it is not just today, but every single day, a gift that you have come into my life. You make me happy, fulfill me and give me strength. Especially today, on our day, I would like to thank you.If you asked me what exactly our relationship is, then I would answer: because your corners fit my edges. I love every flaw, every habit and everything that makes you feel. Because you are the person with whom I would like to spend the rest of my life. We only have time for work once, and once more time for love - we do not have more time left. That's what famous fashion designer Coco Chanel once said. And she is right. When you are with me, I still have the feeling that time stands still. I enjoy every moment and would like to scream my luck and my love for you in the whole world.What would an anniversary be but without surprise? Of course, I've been thinking for a long time about what I could not only make you happy with, but with what we'll later combine together. For this reason, I've considered a surprise trip for you. Just pack a few things, trust me and be ready for a spontaneous adventure with me. I love them very much and hope that you are just as happy about this surprise trip as I already did during the preparations.My darling, for no money in the world I would ever give you back. You are me and I am you. And I wish that this love never ends, but that it will continue to grow and prosper for many years to come. For this reason, I would like to say to you from the bottom of my heart, I love you. And there is a simple reason: because you exist. I remember our first day as if it were yesterday! When I saw you ... When we met for the first time How did we kiss the first time ... These days were the way to the future with you, the love has been burning in me since then, to you, Laubelmay! Do not tell you how happy I am to have you. It's amazing that I could stand it without you for so long. I never thought possible that there is anyone like you. Someone who is as sweet, tender and understanding as you are. I have never before given God something. But today and for all eternity, I hope that our time together never comes to an end, and that in 60 years' time we will still wake up next to each other, looking each other in the eye and telling each other how much we both love each other. I have thought a lot about how it came about that we both know each other and have learned to love each other. An accident? I wondered why we have so much in common. An accident? NO. I do not believe in coincidences and especially when there are so many. But then what is it? Fate? A providence of God? I do not know but I know that you are the only person in my life and will ever be whom I love more than anything I have. As everything that is dear to me ... yes I love you even more than my own life. How crazy I will be if you are not there. How indignant when you step through the door. How willingly, when you kiss me ... .As sunken when I look into your eyes .... How confused if you look at me seriously ... I've never been so sure to love someone from the depths of my soul as I am with you. But your voice makes me feel hot and cold down my spine. You are my star on the darkest night. You are my sun on the rainiest day. You are my great true love This incredibly beautiful feeling to miss you so much that I just want to be with you. The wait when we'll see each other again Finally standing in front of you again. To be able to look into your eyes and just cuddle up to you. To seek and find shelter. You who are just there and my wounds of the past once more heal faster. When we met for the first time your smile never let go. When I saw you the second time my heart jumped and I got scared. Yes, you've read that correctly. I sat in my room and a tear flowed down my cheek as I realized I was falling in love with you and fell in love Not because I was sad about it but because I was afraid to lose control of my heart again. I know my dream has come true. Because this dream Laubelmay is YOU. When I see your face in front of my eyes the thought of you makes me smile. The idea that you hold my hand makes me float. The longing for a hug from you makes my heart race The dream to kiss you ... to kiss !!! The dream of kissing makes me shudder The thought of you makes me strong. Laubelmay, I feel that way because I LOVE YOU. Yes I love you. I do not know how it could happen actually I have always thought of myself that I could not really fall in love but now it happened and I can not change it. No matter how many lines I write to you now, what I feel for you that can not be put into words. I LOVE YOU!!!! I love you about all sweetheart and I need you. You and your love. For almost 4 years you have been giving me the feeling that you are truly being truly loved. I never want to let you go again! From a woman like you I always dreamed and now almost 4 years ago I found my dream wife. It is only almost 4 years but in this 4 year I have experienced so many beautiful things so many beautiful hours with you. And I really NEVER want to lose you again ... With these words I can not express my feelings because there are no words for that. I am grateful to you for every hour and minute that we have spent together. And there will be many more, because I will never give you back. I am always looking forward to our common evenings because it is so beautiful your closeness and warmth to feel your caresses and kisses. You tell me such scary loving things as no one has told me until I met you. I'm so happy to get compliments from you so it makes me very happy. and all I want is YOU! and I want us to be happy together Laubelmay. Hey my heart!

    there is a simple reason: because you exist. I remember our first day as if it were yesterday! When I saw you ... When
    we met for the first time How did we kiss the first time ... These days were the way to the future with you, the love
    has been burning in me since then, to you, Laubelmay! Do not tell you how happy I am to have you. It's amazing that I
    could stand it without you for so long. I never thought possible that there is anyone like you. Someone who is as sweet,
    tender and understanding as you are. I have never before given God something. But today and for all eternity, I hope
    that our time together never comes to an end, and that in 60 years' time we will still wake up next to each other,
    looking each other in the eye and telling each other how much we both love each other. I have thought a lot about how it
    came about that we both know each other and have learned to love each other. An accident? I wondered why we have so much
    in common. An accident? NO. I do not believe in coincidences and especially when there are so many. But then what is it?
    Fate? A providence of God? I do not know but I know that you are the only person in my life and will ever be whom I love
    more than anything I have. As everything that is dear to me ... yes I love you even more than my own life. How crazy I
    will be if you are not there. How indignant when you step through the door. How willingly, when you kiss me ... .As
    sunken when I look into your eyes .... How confused if you look at me seriously ... I've never been so sure to love
    someone from the depths of my soul as I am with you. But your voice makes me feel hot and cold down my spine. You are my
    star on the darkest night. You are my sun on the rainiest day. You are my great true love This incredibly beautiful
    feeling to miss you so much that I just want to be with you. The wait when we'll see each other again Finally standing
    in front of you again. when we'll see you before, it is a privilege to love you but also to be loved by you and I am more than happy that I may be the ones.
    Without you, life is meaningless and empty. Like the depth of the sea.To look in your eyes is like the starry sky. There
    is no choice but to look into it. Your smile you lose in this. There is no choice but to smile with you. Your laughter
    are the most beautiful sounds this world has heard. There is no choice but to laugh. Your voice is a unique tune. There
    is no choice but to listen. Your touch is like a soulful dance on the skin. There is no choice but to enjoy it. You.
    There is no choice but to love you. My angel,How I wish that you were by my side now. The yearning for you is growing
    every day and I miss you more than words can ever say. Without you, I feel incomplete. You leave a big gap as soon as
    you go again. But even if you live in another country and we do not see each other very often, I feel so incredibly
    close to you. No limit to the world can separate us. Because I love you! And this love overcomes every distance, every
    barrier, every country in the world. When you are with me and I hold you in my arms, time suddenly seems to stand still.
    And yet the time passes with you too fast. It slides like sand out of my fingers and I try to hold on to it every time,
    so as not to let you go again. Because among all the women in the world you are the one to which every man hopes. You
    are the woman who makes my heart beat faster even after all the time we are together. It manages to make me stand up at
    the airport with my knees trembling, thinking, "It will arrive right away!" You make me weak and at the same time so
    incredibly strong!Since you came into my life, I have the feeling that I finally know what it really means to live. You
    are so much more than my partner. You are my inspiration, my compass, my best friend. Waking up at your side every day
    is my biggest wish. I want to share every adventure with you, sharing every experience with you. For what is more
    beautiful than to grow beyond yourself with his soul mate? Darling, you make life so incredibly worth living and for
    that I want to thank you! You are more than I have ever wanted!I know that we do not see each other as often as our
    hearts wish. But every day, every hour with you is so infinitely precious. When I think about seeing you again, I feel a
    tingling in my whole body! And so I often find myself dreaming to you in the distance and to lay in my thoughts to you.
    Wake you up and experience one more of these wonderful days together that make life so precious.You should always know
    one thing: in my thoughts I am always with you! And in the heart we are always close! No matter where we are right now.I
    love you with my whole heart! I'm so sorry about what happened yesterday between us. I do not know either, lately I'm
    almost in a bad mood, because the work gets more and more tedious and of course leaves that to you ...I really did not
    want to yell at you and certainly do not have any stupid comments popping on your head. You know, you are the most
    important thing in my life and I love you about everything in the world. I can only imagine my future together with you.
    You have become part of me, my better half, my life content, something very special, that deserves to be treated
    differently.Ever since I saw you for the first time, I knew it: this is the woman I love and with whom I can grow old
    and happy.I admit my mistake and hereby give you my word of honor that such a thing will never happen again.Trust is
    very important to me and you know that this has always played an important role in our relationship so far. That will
    not change, my angel.Only you and me against the rest of the world!Do you forgive me? I know you are modest and always
    embarrassed when complimented, but you are just beautiful. When your hair blows in the wind, your eyes are beaming, and
    your nose is kissed by the sun, and that's why it's so cute, then every time I wonder if you're not an angel on
    earth.Listening to your voice always gives me goose bumps, especially in the moments when you pay attention to me alone.
    If you're happy, then I have to smile all the time and get infected by your good mood. I do not know how you do that,
    but you always enchant me again and again. No matter what, if I know I'll see you, then the day will be fine. You are my
    sun. For you, I like to get up every day, just to see you shine so beautifully.Hello my darling,all the love for our
    anniversary. For me, it is not just today, but every single day, a gift that you have come into my life. You make me
    happy, fulfill me and give me strength. Especially today, on our day, I would like to thank you.If you asked me what
    exactly our relationship is, then I would answer: because your corners fit my edges. I love every flaw, every habit and
    everything that makes you feel. Because you are the person with whom I would like to spend the rest of my life. We only
    have time for work once, and once more time for love - we do not have more time left. That's what famous fashion
    designer Coco Chanel once said. And she is right. When you are with me, I still have the feeling that time stands still.
    I enjoy every moment and would like to scream my luck and my love for you in the whole world.What would an anniversary
    be but without surprise? Of course, I've been thinking for a long time about what I could not only make you happy with,
    but with what we'll later combine together. For this reason, I've considered a surprise trip for you. Just pack a few
    things, trust me and be ready for a spontaneous adventure with me. I love them very much and hope that you are just as
    happy about this surprise trip as I already did during the preparations.My darling, for no money in the world I would
    ever give you back. You are me and I am you. And I wish that this love never ends, but that it will continue to grow and
    prosper for many years to come. For this reason, I would like to say to you from the bottom of my heart, I love you. And
    there is a simple reason: because you exist. I remember our first day as if it were yesterday! When I saw you ... When
    we met for the first time How did we kiss the first time ... These days were the way to the future with you, the love
    has been burning in me since then, to you, Laubelmay! Do not tell you how happy I am to have you. It's amazing that I
    could stand it without you for so long. I never thought possible that there is anyone like you. Someone who is as sweet,
    tender and understanding as you are. I have never before given God something. But today and for all eternity, I hope
    that our time together never comes to an end, and that in 60 years' time we will still wake up next to each other,
    looking each other in the eye and telling each other how much we both love each other. I have thought a lot about how it
    came about that we both know each other and have learned to love each other. An accident? I wondered why we have so much
    in common. An accident? NO. I do not believe in coincidences and especially when there are so many. But then what is it?
    Fate? A providence of God? I do not know but I know that you are the only person in my life and will ever be whom I love
    more than anything I have. As everything that is dear to me ... yes I love you even more than my own life. How crazy I
    will be if you are not there. How indignant when you step through the door. How willingly, when you kiss me ... .As
    sunken when I look into your eyes .... How confused if you look at me seriously ... I've never been so sure to love
    someone from the depths of my soul as I am with you. But your voice makes me feel hot and cold down my spine. You are my
    star on the darkest night. You are my sun on the rainiest day. You are my great true love This incredibly beautiful
    feeling to miss you so much that I just want to be with you. The wait when we'll see each other again Finally standing
